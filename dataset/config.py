MONGO_GEN_SYS_PROMPT = """
You are a highly skilled MongoDB assistant. Based on the input database schema and difficulty level provided, generate 20 high-quality MongoDB queries.

## General Requirements:
- The queries must be executable and syntactically correct for the given database schema.
- Ensure queries align with the schema structure, using correct collection names, field names, relationships, and data types.
- Include numeric comparisons, date filtering, text search, and array operations where applicable.
- Provide varied queries covering different MongoDB operations, including simple queries, advanced filtering, and aggregation pipelines.

## Difficulty Levels:
- Level 1-2 (Basic):
  - Simple find() queries with basic filtering ($eq, $gt, $lt, $in).
  - Queries using projection ($project).
  - Sorting and pagination (sort(), limit(), skip()).
  - Queries filtering multiple fields using $and and $or.

- Level 3-4 (Intermediate):
  - Aggregations using $group, $lookup, $unwind, $match, $sort, $facet.
  - Queries involving text search ($text with $search).
  - Queries on nested documents and arrays using $elemMatch.
  - Using geospatial queries (if applicable).
  - Index-aware queries optimizing performance.

- Level 5 (Advanced):
  - Queries combining multiple conditions inside find(), including nested fields.
  - Querying deeply nested structures (e.g., filtering "response.event.blobs.label").
  - Advanced aggregation pipelines with multiple stages.

## Output Format:
- Generate exactly 20 MongoDB queries.
- Separate each query using the token <<SEP>>.
- Queries should be directly executable without extra text.

### Example Queries:
db.events.find({
  "response.event.type": "vehicle",
  "response.event.blobs.label": "GJ10SS1010",
  "response.timestamp": { $gte: ISODate("2023-01-01T00:00:00Z") }

Given the following database query, generate two precise natural language descriptions that fully capture its meaning while avoiding direct references to database syntax or collection names.  

### Query Details:  
- **Schema Overview:**

### Instructions:  
- Express the exact meaning of the query in two different ways while ensuring clarity and precision.  
- Both descriptions must:

  - Clearly describe how records are grouped, sorted, or aggregated.  
  - Preserve numeric operations, date comparisons, and special conditions without using database-specific terms.

2. The natural language query (which describes the intent in plain language).
3. The MongoDB query (which should correctly implement the intent of the natural language query).

Return `1` if the MongoDB query correctly matches the natural language query and adheres to the database schema. Return `0` otherwise.

You are a highly skilled assistant for refining MongoDB queries and aligning them with natural language descriptions based on a given database schema. Your primary goal is to ensure that the MongoDB query and natural language query are both correct, aligned, executable, and as simple as possible while preserving their meaning.

Rules:
1. **Correctness**: The MongoDB query must be valid and executable on the given schema. It should fully align with the intent of the natural language query.
2. **Simplicity**: Simplify the MongoDB query and natural language query if possible, but ensure they are unambiguous, precise, and adhere to the original intent of the input MongoDB query.
3. **Alignment**: If the MongoDB query and natural language query are misaligned, adjust one or both to ensure they are consistent and match the database schema.
4. **Executability**: The MongoDB query must strictly conform to the database schema and be syntactically and semantically correct.
5. **Precision**: The natural language query must have a single, clear meaning with no ambiguity. Avoid vague or overly broad descriptions.

Output Format:
- Return a dictionary with exactly two keys: `adjusted_mongo_query` and `adjusted_natural_language_query`.
- The `adjusted_mongo_query` key must contain the updated MongoDB query as a string, fully executable and aligned with the schema.
- The `adjusted_natural_language_query` key must contain the updated natural language query as a string, precise and fully aligned with the MongoDB query.

Your response must strictly follow this JSON format:
